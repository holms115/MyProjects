"WritingAndEssays" within "MyProjects" is an assortment of my writing from different college classes
I have taken so far. I have included a spread of classes and contexts in which these essays were written 
to best display the different styles and purposes I can fulfill. 

"To Be As Brave as Your Heart Wishes," an analysis of the film "Kagemusha" directed by 
Akira Kurosawa, unravels ideas of honor as understood within historical Japanese
culture and how one might want to consider taking such ethics to heart today. 

"Meditating on Existential Fulfillment in 'Ulysses'" dives into Alfred Lord Tennyson's
poem "Ulysses" and builds a framework on how one attains meaning with respect to the poem's namesake 
and his desire for imperialistic ventures.

"The Symbolism of the Wallpaper in 'The Yellow Wallpaper'" is a close reading scrutinizing the eerie
presence of a viscerally disturbing wallpaper in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper"
and what it has to say about the relevance of feminism and women's voices in their personal relationships.

"Competitive Scholarship Essay" is a competitive 297 word essay (requested 300) answering the prompts: 
"Why did you choose to study abroad?" 
"Why do you believe you should receive this aid?"
"How will studying abroad help you in pursying your long-term goals?"

Enjoy!
